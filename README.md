This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in Bash scripting: incorrect input redirection.  The `bug.sh` script contains the flawed code, while `bugSolution.sh` provides the corrected version. The error lies in how the script attempts to read data from a file passed as a command-line argument.  The documentation highlights the correct usage of the input redirection operator (`<`) for seamless file processing in bash scripts. This example is helpful for understanding and avoiding common pitfalls when working with file input and output in shell scripts.
